Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Manchester United and captains the Portugal national team. Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA European Championship, and one UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), most goals (140), and assists (42) in the Champions League, most goals in the European Championship (14), most international goals by a male player (115), and most international appearances by a European male (186). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored over 800 official senior career goals for club and country.

Born and raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go onto win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million), where he won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, and four Champions Leagues, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer. He won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and the most expensive transfer for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppe Italiana, and a Coppa Italia, before returning to Manchester United in 2021.

Ronaldo made his senior international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned over 180 caps, making him Portugal's most-capped player. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the nation's all-time top goalscorer. He has played in and scored at 11 major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed full captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.

One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.

Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[9][10] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man.[11] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[12] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia".[13] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure.[14] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[15]

As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[16] where his father was the kit man,[11] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[17] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting's youth academy.[17] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[18] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.[18] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[19] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[20] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[21]

At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[22] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[17] A year later, on 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[23] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[24] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer.[25]

Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[26] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million[26] for what he considered to be "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.[27] A decade after his departure from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.[28]

Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[30] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[31] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[32] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[33] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."[34]


Ronaldo playing for Manchester United against Chelsea in the 2005–06 Premier League season
Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt.[35] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.[29] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[36] Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[37] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career.[38] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy.[39] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final.[40] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his "elaborate" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[41] but teammate Gary Neville said he was "not a show pony, but the real thing", and predicted he would become a world-class player.[42]

"He has got the tricks and party pieces, we know that, but they're not much good unless there is something at the end of it all. We still have to remember, of course, that the lad is only 19 years of age. Considering that, you have to say he has got massive talent. His feet are mesmerising at times, and if he can couple that with some consistently good crossing, the future looks frightening."
—Former BBC pundit Alan Hansen commenting on Ronaldo after his first season.[40]

Ronaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4–1 loss to Middlesbrough.[43] A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010.[44] At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.[45][46] He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5–4.[47] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic.[48]

During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a "one-fingered gesture" towards Benfica fans,[49] and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3–1 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole.[50] Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.[51] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[52] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident.[53] United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[54]

Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season,[55] it proved to be his breakout year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach René Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known.[56] He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading.[57][58][59] Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.[60]

At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition,[61] scoring twice in a 7–1 win over Roma.[62] He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,[63] but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro.[64] He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat.[65] Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years.[66] As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award,[67][68] becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours.[69] His wages were concurrently upgraded to £120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension.[70] Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d'Or,[71] and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.[72]

Ronaldo scored his first and only hat-trick for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table.[73] On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2–0 win.[74] His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, which bettered George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season, thus setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder.[75] His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot,[76] as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.[77] He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season.[78][79] In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon, which helped United advance to the quarter-finals 2–1 on aggregate;[80] while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3–0 aggregate win over Roma.[81] United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out,[82] United emerged victorious.[83] As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.[84]

Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him.[85] As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action.[86] FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as "modern slavery".[87] Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter,[88] he remained at United for another year.[89]

Ahead of the 2008–09 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery,[90] which kept him out of action for 10 weeks.[91] Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5–0 win against Stoke City on 15 November,[92] which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time.[93] At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan,[94] assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process.[95] With his 2008 Ballon d'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968,[96] and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.[97]

His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year;[98] he later called it the best goal he had ever scored.[99] United advanced to the final in Rome,[100] where he made little impact in United's 2–0 defeat to Barcelona.[101] Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup.[102][103] He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances.[104] His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.[105]

Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time, of £80 million (€94 million).[106] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.[107] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[108] Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[109] which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[110]

Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August and scored from the penalty spot in Madrid's 3–2 home win.[111] He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so.[112] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[113] His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[114][115] A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería.[116] Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi of Barcelona, Madrid's rivals. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga.[117][118] His first season at Madrid ended trophyless.[119]

Following Raúl's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010–11 season.[120] His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6–1 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October.[121] His haul concluded a run of scoring in six consecutive matches for club and country, totalling 11 goals, the most he had scored in a single month. Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and Málaga.[122][123][124] Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or.[125] During a historic series of four Clásicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain.[126][127] His two goals in the last match of the season against Almería made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals.[128] In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.[129]

During the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions.[130] He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, Málaga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point.[131][132][133] Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona,[134] he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás.[135] Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atlético Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season.[136] His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi,[137] though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.[138]

Ronaldo began the 2012–13 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de España, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4–4 aggregate draw against Barcelona.[139] Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a "professional issue" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid,[140] his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4–1 win over Ajax.[141] Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou.[142] His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.[143]

Following the 2012–13 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4–3 win over Sociedad on 6 January.[144] He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.[145] Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe.[146] He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6–2 win against Málaga, reaching the landmark in 197 games.[147] He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Clásico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored,[148] a club record.[139] In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2–1 defeat to Atlético, but was shown a red card for violent conduct.[149] In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at home,[150] he scored the winning goal in a 2–1 win on his first return to Old Trafford.[151] He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect.[152] After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4–1 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2–0 win in the second leg.[153]

At the start of the 2013–14 season, Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of €17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football.[154] He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee of €100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior.[155] Together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed "BBC", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).[156] By late November, Ronaldo had scored 32 goals from 22 matches for both club and country, including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland, and Sweden.[157][158][159] He ended 2013 with 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally.[160] He received the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.[161]

Concurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La Décima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3–0 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before.[162] After hitting a brace in a 4–0 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena,[163] he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4–1 final win over Atlético, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams.[164] His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: "In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks".[165] As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals,[166] he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.[167]

In the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atlético at the Vicente Calderón,[168] the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match.[169] His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2–1 to claim the trophy.[170] Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Suárez.[171] Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eusébio, who had died two days before.[172] A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional,[173] which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.[174]

During the 2014–15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, starting with both goals in Madrid's 2–0 win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[175] He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with 15 goals in the first eight rounds.[176] His record 23rd La Liga hat-trick, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in La Liga, reaching the milestone in 178th matches.[176][177] After winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup,[178] Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or,[179] joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient.[180] Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League.[181] In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2–0 win against Schalke 04.[182] He scored both of his side's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 3–2 on aggregate.[183] With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar.[184] On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9–1 rout of Granada.[185] His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2–0 win against Rayo Vallecano.[186] Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di Stéfano's club record of 28.[175] He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.[175]

At the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015–16 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6–0 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's previous record holder, Raúl.[187] A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Raúl when he scored the second goal in a 3–0 defeat of Levante at the Bernabéu to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals.[note 4] Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals.[189] Two goals against Malmö FF in a 2–0 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country.[190] He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malmö.[191]

Ronaldo's four goals in a 7–1 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 took his total to 252 goals in La Liga, becoming the competition's second-highest scorer in history behind Messi.[192] He scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals.[193] The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals, making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season and the fifth overall.[194] Suffering apparent fitness issues, Ronaldo gave a poorly-received performance in the final against Atlético, in a repeat of the 2014 final, though his penalty in the subsequent shoot-out secured Madrid's 11th victory.[195] For the sixth successive year, he ended the season having scored over 50 goals across all competitions.[195] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time.[196]

Ronaldo missed Madrid's first three matches of the 2016–17 season, including the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, as he continued to rehabilitate the knee injury he suffered against France in the Euro 2016 final.[197] On 15 September, he did not celebrate his late free kick equaliser against Sporting CP in the Champions League, with Ronaldo stating post match that "they made me who I am".[198] On 7 November, his contract was updated for the second time and extended by three years to 2021.[199] On 19 November, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 away win against Atlético, making him the all-time top scorer in the Madrid derby with 18 goals.[200] On 15 December, Ronaldo scored his 500th club career goal in the 2–0 win over Club América in the semi-finals of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[201] He then scored a hat-trick in the 4–2 win over Japanese club Kashima Antlers in the final.[202] Ronaldo finished the tournament as top scorer with four goals and was also named player of the tournament.[203] He won the 2016 Ballon d'Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.[204]

In the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League quarter-final against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2–1 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition.[205] In the second leg of the quarter-finals, Ronaldo scored a 'perfect' hat-trick and reached his 100th Champions League goal, becoming the first player to do so as Madrid again defeated Bayern 4–2 after extra-time.[206] On 2 May, Ronaldo scored another hat-trick as Madrid defeated Atlético 3–0 in the Champions League semi-final first leg. On 17 May, Ronaldo overtook Jimmy Greaves as the all-time top scorer in the top five European leagues, scoring twice against Celta de Vigo.[207] He finished the season with 42 goals in all competitions as he helped Madrid to win their first La Liga title since 2012.[208] In the Champions League Final, Ronaldo scored two goals in a 4–1 victory over Juventus to take him to 12 goals for the season, making him the competition's top goalscorer for the fifth straight season (sixth overall), as well as the first player to score in three finals in the Champions League era; the second goal was the 600th of his senior career.[209] Madrid also became the first team to win back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.[210]

At the start of the 2017–18 season, Ronaldo scored Madrid's second goal in the 80th minute of a 3–1 win over Barcelona in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España at Camp Nou; however, he was sent off two minutes later and missed the second leg.[211] On 23 October, his performances throughout 2017 saw him awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year.[212] On 6 December, he became the first player to score in all six Champions League group stage matches with a curling strike at home to Dortmund.[213] A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d'Or, receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris.[214] On 16 December, he scored a free kick winner, as Madrid won their second Club World Cup in a row by beating Grêmio in the final.[215] On 3 March 2018, he scored two goals in a 3–1 home win over Getafe, his first being his 300th La Liga goal in his 286th appearance, making him the fastest player to reach this landmark and only the second player to do so after Messi.[216] On 18 March, he reached his 50th career hat-trick, scoring four goals in a 6–3 win against Girona.[217]

On 3 April, Ronaldo scored the first two goals in a 3–0 away win against Juventus in the quarter-finals of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, with his second goal being an acrobatic bicycle kick. Described as a "PlayStation goal" by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo's foot approximately 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches.[218] On 11 April, he scored in the second leg at home to Juventus, a 98th-minute injury time penalty in a 3–1 defeat, meaning Madrid advanced 4–3 on aggregate.[219] It was his tenth goal against Juventus, a Champions League record against a single club.[220] In the final on 26 May, Madrid defeated Liverpool 3–1, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title, the first player to do so.[221] He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season with 15 goals.[222] After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave the club.[223]

Despite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract,[224] on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a €100 million transfer, which included an additional €12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs.[225] The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old,[226] and the highest paid by an Italian club.[227] Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid,[228] but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.[229]

On 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3–2 away win against ChievoVerona.[230] On 16 September, Ronaldo scored his first two goals for Juventus in his fourth appearance in a 2–1 home win over Sassuolo in Serie A; his second was the 400th league goal of his career.[231] On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juventus, he was sent off in the 29th minute for "violent conduct", his first red card in 154 tournament appearances.[232] Ronaldo became the first player in history to win 100 Champions League matches, setting up Mario Mandžukić's winner in a 1–0 home win over Valencia, which sealed Juventus's passage to the knock-out stages of the competition.[233] In December, he scored his tenth league goal of the season, from the penalty spot, netting the final goal in a 3–0 away win over Fiorentina.[234] After placing second in both the 2018 UEFA Men's Player of the Year and 2018 The Best FIFA Men's Player for the first time in three years, behind Luka Modrić, Ronaldo performances in 2018 also saw him voted runner-up for the 2018 Ballon d'Or, finishing once again behind his former Real Madrid teammate.[235] Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan.[236]

On 10 February, Ronaldo scored in a 3–0 win over Sassuolo, the ninth consecutive away game in which he had scored in the league, equalling Giuseppe Signori's single season Serie A record of most consecutive away games with at least one goal.[237] On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win against Atlético in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, helping Juventus overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals.[238] The following month, Ronaldo scored his 125th goal in the competition, opening the scoring in a 1–1 away draw in the first leg of Juventus' quarter-final against Ajax, on 10 April.[239] In the second leg in Turin on 16 April, he scored the opening goal, but Juventus eventually lost the match 2–1 and were eliminated from the competition.[240] On 20 April, Ronaldo played in the scudetto clinching game against Fiorentina, as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a 2–1 home win, thereby becoming the first player to win league titles in England, Spain and Italy.[241] On 27 April, he scored his 600th club goal, the equaliser in a 1–1 away draw against Derby d'Italia rivals Inter Milan.[242] Finishing his first Serie A campaign with 21 goals and 8 assists, Ronaldo won the inaugural Serie A award for Most Valuable Player.[243]

Ronaldo scored his first goal of the 2019–20 season in a 4–3 home win over Napoli in Serie A on 31 August 2019.[244] On 23 September, he came in 3rd place for the Best FIFA Men's Player Award.[245] On 1 October, he reached several milestones in Juventus's 3–0 Champions League group stage win over Bayer Leverkusen: he scored in a 14th consecutive Champions League season, equalling Raúl and Messi's record; he broke Iker Casillas' record for most Champions League wins of all time and equalled Raúl's record of scoring against 33 different Champions League opponents.[246] On 6 November, in a 2–1 away win against Lokomotiv Moscow, he equalled Paolo Maldini as the second-most capped player in UEFA club competitions with 174 appearances.[247] On 18 December, Ronaldo leapt to a height of 8 ft 5 in (2.57 m), higher than the crossbar, to head the winning goal in a 2–1 away win against Sampdoria.[248] Ronaldo scored his first Serie A hat-trick on 6 January 2020, in a 4–0 home win against Cagliari. His 56th career hat-trick, he became only the second player after Alexis Sánchez to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A.[249] On 2 February, he scored twice from the penalty spot in a 3–0 home win over Fiorentina, equalling David Trezeguet's club record of scoring in nine consecutive league games,[250] and broke the record six days later by scoring in his tenth consecutive league game, a 2–1 away defeat to Hellas Verona.[251] On 22 February, Ronaldo scored for a record-equalling 11th consecutive league game, alongside Gabriel Batistuta and Fabio Quagliarella, in what was his 1,000th senior professional game, a 2–1 away win against SPAL.[252]

On 22 June, he scored a penalty in a 2–0 away win over Bologna, overtaking Rui Costa to become the highest scoring Portuguese player in Serie A history.[253] On 4 July, he scored his 25th league goal of the season from a free kick in a 4–1 home win over rivals Torino, becoming the first Juventus player to achieve this milestone since Omar Sívori in 1961; the goal was also his first from a free kick with the club after 43 attempts.[254] On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2–1 home win over Lazio; his first goal was his 50th in Serie A. He became the second-fastest player to reach this landmark, after Gunnar Nordahl, and the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. With his brace, he also reached 30 league goals for the season, becoming just the third player (after Felice Borel in 1934 and John Hansen in 1952) in Juventus's history to reach that milestone in a season.[255][256] Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948.[257] On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2–0 home win over Sampdoria, which saw Juventus crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time.[258] He finished his second league campaign with 31 goals, making him the second-highest goalscorer in the league behind only European Golden Shoe winner Ciro Immobile, with 36 goals.[259][260] On 7 August, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 2–1 home win against Lyon in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, which saw him finish the season with 37 goals in all competitions; the tally allowed him to break Borel's club record of 36 goals in a single season.[261] Despite the win, the tie finished 2–2 on aggregate and Juventus were eliminated from the competition on the away goals rule.[262]

On 20 September 2020, Ronaldo scored in Juventus's opening league match of the season, a 3–0 home win over Sampdoria.[263] On 1 November, after Ronaldo took nearly three weeks to recover from COVID-19, he returned to action against Spezia; he came off the bench in the second half and scored within the first three minutes, before scoring a second goal from the penalty spot in an eventual 4–1 away win.[264] On 2 December, he scored a goal against Dynamo Kyiv in a Champions League group stage match to reach his 750th senior career goal.[265] Ronaldo played his 100th match in all competitions for Juventus on 13 December, scoring two penalties in a 3–1 away win over Genoa in the league to bring his goal tally to 79.[266] On 20 January 2021, Juventus won the 2020 Supercoppa Italiana after a 2–0 win against Napoli, with Ronaldo scoring the opening goal.[267] On 2 March, he scored a goal in a 3–0 win over Spezia in his 600th league match, to become the first player to score at least 20 goals in 12 consecutive seasons in the top five leagues of Europe.[268] On 9 March, Juventus were knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 by Porto, again on the away goals rule (4–4 on aggregate).[269] On 14 March, he scored his 57th career hat-trick in a 3–1 away win over Cagliari.[270] On 12 May, Ronaldo scored a goal in a 3–1 away win over Sassuolo to reach his 100th goal for Juventus in all competitions on his 131st appearance, becoming the fastest Juventus player to achieve the feat.[271] With Juventus's victory in the 2021 Coppa Italia Final on 19 May, Ronaldo became the first player in history to win every major domestic trophy in England, Spain and Italy.[272] Ronaldo ended the season with 29 league goals, winning the Capocannoniere award for highest goalscorer and becoming the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues.[273]

On 22 August, Ronaldo started the first game of the new season on the bench, coming on as a substitute for Álvaro Morata in a 2–2 draw against Udinese, scoring a goal that was ruled out by VAR.[274] Though manager Massimiliano Allegri confirmed it was his decision due to Ronaldo's fitness, it came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window,[275] and Ronaldo would tell Allegri he had "no intention" of remaining a Juventus player.[276] On 26 August, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reached a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms,[277] but the club pulled out of the deal the following day due to the overall cost of the transfer.[278] On the same day, it was confirmed that City's rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo's former club, were in advanced talks to sign him,[279][280] while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.[281][282]

On 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical.[283] The transfer was reported as costing an initial £12.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August.[284] Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21.[285] The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.[286]

On 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4–1 league victory against Newcastle United.[287] On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2–1 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League, and overtaking Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition.[288] On 2 December, Ronaldo scored twice in a 3–2 home league win against Arsenal, taking him past 800 top-level career goals.[289]

On 12 March 2022, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3–2 victory against Tottenham, bringing his total goal count to 807 in the process.[290] He is believed to be the record holder for goals scored in professional football, although the Football Association of the Czech Republic argues that Josef Bican scored 821 goals.[291][292]

Ronaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.[6]

Aged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1–0 win over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003,[293] coming on as a half-time substitute for Luís Figo.[294] He was subsequently called up for UEFA Euro 2004, held in his home country, and scored his first international goal in a 2–1 group stage loss to eventual champions Greece, his eighth appearance for Portugal.[294] After converting his penalty in a shoot-out against England in the quarter-finals,[295] he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2–1 win over the Netherlands.[296] He was featured in the team of the tournament, having provided two assists in addition to his two goals.[297]

Ronaldo was Portugal's second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals.[293] During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal's second match of the group stage.[298] At the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals.[299] In Portugal's infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz.[294] Following Portugal's 1–0 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game.[300] In Portugal's quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction,[301] the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal.[294][302] Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals.[294] Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1–0 semi-final defeat to France.[303] FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.[294][304] Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.[305][306]

One day after his 22nd birthday, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007,[307] as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier.[308] Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time.[309] While he scored eight goals in the qualification,[310] the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3–1 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic; in the same game, he also set-up Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance.[311][312] Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3–2 loss against eventual finalists Germany.[313]

After Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United.[314] Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008.[315] Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup,[294] as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina.[316] In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil.[317][318][319] His only goal of the tournament came in their 7–0 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months.[320] Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1–0 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.[321]

Ronaldo scored seven goals in the qualification for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a "group of death".[322] In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2–1 win.[323] He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1–0 win.[324] In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match.[325][326] After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, with Ronaldo having sent three shots over the bar,[327] Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot,[328] a decision that was questioned by the media.[329][330][331] Ronaldo's own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo "demanded" to take the last penalty.[332] As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.

During the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1–1 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap.[333] His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4–2 qualifying win on 6 September 2013.[334] After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimović, which ensured their place at the tournament.[335] His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equaling Pauleta's record.[336] Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5–1 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.[337]

Ronaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury,[338][339] potentially risking his career.[340] Ronaldo later commented: "If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't."[341] Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice,[342] Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4–0 defeat.[343] After assisting an injury-time 2–2 equaliser against the United States,[344] he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2–1 win over Ghana.[345] His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups.[346] Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.[345]


Ronaldo leaps in the air in Portugal's Euro 2016 quarter-final match against Poland
Ronaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016.[347] With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the UEFA European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's all-time leading goalscorer.[348] At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal's draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as Portugal's most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half.[349] With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3–3 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament.[350][351] Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format,[352] despite not winning any of their games.[294]

In Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia's goalkeeper Danijel Subašić into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1–0 win late in extra time.[294] After his team progressed past Poland on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal's opening penalty,[294] he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals;[353] he scored the opener in a 2–0 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals.[354] In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on,[294] he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1–0 victory.[355] As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.[356][357]

Following the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2–3 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Estádio dos Barreiros. With the goal, he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.[358]

In Portugal's opening match of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup against Mexico on 17 June, Ronaldo set up Quaresma's opening goal in a 2–2 draw.[359] Three days later, he scored in a 1–0 win over hosts Russia.[360] On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a 4–0 win over New Zealand, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition; with his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled Sándor Kocsis as the second-highest European international goalscorer of all-time, behind only Ferenc Puskás.[361][362] He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches.[363] Ronaldo left the competition early; after Chile defeated Portugal 3–0 on penalties in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children,[364] and missed Portugal's third-place play-off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2–1 after extra time.[365]
On 31 August 2017, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 win in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match over the Faroe Islands, which saw him overtake Pelé and equal Hussein Saeed as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals.[366] These goals brought his tally in the World Cup qualifiers to 14, equalling Predrag Mijatović's record for most goals in a single UEFA qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a European qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by David Healy and Robert Lewandowski. Ronaldo's hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose.[367] Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2–0 win.[368]

On 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup match, helping Portugal secure a 3–3 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese player to score a goal in four World Cups and one of four players of any nationality to do so.[369] On 20 June, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against Morocco, breaking Puskás' record as the highest European goalscorer of all-time, with 85 international goals.[370] In the final group match against Iran on 25 June, Ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw which saw Portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind Spain.[371] On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2–1 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16.[372] For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.[373]
After the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, but played for hosts Portugal in the inaugural Nations League Finals in June 2019. In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to reach the final.
